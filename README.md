# iOSResume
Resume app made using Swift, autolayout and retrieviend data from a public gist

- MVC was used due to the size and hurry of the project

- App works in portrait and landscape mode.

- The views were developed using storyboards and some xibs to show dominance of both(I prefer using only xibs anyway)

*Activity indicator implementation pending to show data being loaded*

The follwing gists can be edited to modify the information shown:
